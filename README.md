## Task Completion Rewards

### Stage 1: ðŸ’° 
- Deploy an ERC20 contract on the Sepolia testnet using Remix. Requirements: Initial supply of 21 million tokens, only the admin can burn their own tokens, and the contract code must be open-sourced on Etherscan.
- Deploy an ERC721 contract on the Sepolia testnet using Remix. Requirements: Store images on IPFS, make them visible on OpenSea.
- Write a Market contract. Requirements: Use your issued ERC20 contract to buy and sell NFTs. NFT holders can list their NFTs and set a price (how many tokens are required to purchase the NFT). Other addresses can buy the NFT by transferring the required number of tokens.

### Stage 2: ðŸ’° 
- Get familiar with the Foundry development framework, deploy the Market contract from Stage 1, and write tests for its functionality.

### Stage 3: ðŸ’° 
- Get familiar with UniswapV2, and use the Foundry framework to deploy, write tests for adding liquidity, swap, and removing liquidity functions.

### Stage 4: ðŸ’° 
- Complete all three tasks in the ChainlinkLearningPath: [https://github.com/QingyangKong/ChainlinkLearningPath](https://github.com/QingyangKong/ChainlinkLearningPath).

### Demoday Outstanding Projects: ðŸ’° 800-1200 CNY
- Based on the number of participants, around two Demoday outstanding project awards will be set. Participants can freely form teams with other members and submit Demoday projects (teams should have 1-4 members).


### Submission
- After completing the tasks, submit them to the corresponding folder in the GitHub repository.
